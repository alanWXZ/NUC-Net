NUC-Net: Non-uniform Cylindrical Partition Network for Efficient LiDAR Semantic Segmentation


## Project Overview
NUC-Net is a network based on non-uniform cylindrical partitioning for efficient LiDAR semantic segmentation. This method overcomes the high computational cost of traditional -based approaches by adaptively partitioning point cloud data, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of LiDAR point cloud processing in large-scale environments.

## Updates
- The code will be publicly released soon. Stay tuned.

## Features
- Efficient LiDAR point cloud segmentation
- Non-uniform cylindrical partitioning strategy
- Faster and more accurate processing of large-scale scenes
- A few lines of code are enough to bring a significant improvement.
